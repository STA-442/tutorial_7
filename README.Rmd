# tutorial_7

This tutorial features two markdown files (and their knitted versions):

- rmarkdown-mathmode.Rmd - This document gives a short tutorial on writing equations/statistical models within Rmarkdown. This will likely be useful for assignments and any future work you do.
- glmer-tutorial - We walk through doing a multilevel logistic regression to analyse how referees call fouls in college basketball.
